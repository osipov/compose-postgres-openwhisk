# Demo Serverless Computing app 

This Bluemix application demonstrates how an OpenWhisk action can be used to validate unstructured data, add value to the data using 3rd party services, and to persist the high value data in an IBM Compose managed database server. The stateless, serverless action executed by OpenWhisk is implemented as a Node.JS app, packaged as a Docker container.
